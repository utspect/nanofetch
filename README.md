# nanofetch
> A native command-line system information utility for Windows 7/8/8.1/10 and server equivalents.

**nanofetch** is a native command-line system information utility written in PureBasic for a myriad of Windows versions.

# Why another (xyz)fetch?
I felt like there wasn't a decent native and fast implementation of fetch for Windows versions below 10, mostly due to the fact that they are written in PowerShell and Windows 8 and below lack most of the new implementations introduced in Windows 10.<br><br> **nanofetch** runs in Windows 10 all the way down to Windows 2000.

# Installation
Just drop the appropriate version for your CPU in a directory, add it to your PATH and call it via your favourite terminal emulator or directly via cmd.
